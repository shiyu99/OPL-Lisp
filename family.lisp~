;;;HELPFUL TOPLEVEL HINTS:

;;; To run your program, first load it into the LispWorks Editor,
;;; then click on the "Compile Buffer" button on the top of the
;;; Editor window.  Then, in the LISTENER, you can call any of
;;; the functions in the program file.
;;;
;;; If you find yourself in an error, and you want to know how
;;; you got to that point in the program, when the textual debugger
;;; message appears, you can click on the "Debug" button at the
;;; top of the LISTENER window.  You'll get a GUI debugger that
;;; will show you things like the call stack, the values of the
;;; local variables, and, if you click on a call stack entry,
;;; if the entry corresponds to a function in your program, the
;;; Editor will immediately jump you to the line of code where
;;; the error occured.  Ask in class if you have trouble with
;;; this neat feature. 


;;;HELPFUL PROGRAMMING HINTS:
;;; To create a person structure, use the automatically-generated
;;; function "make-person" as follows:
;;;
;;; (make-person :name xxx :parent1 yyy :parent2 zzz)
;;;
;;; where "xxx" is the string or symbol (or a variable holding it)
;;; for the name of the person, "yyy" is the string or symbol for
;;; the name of the person's first parent, and "zzz" is of course
;;; the name of the person's second parent.
;;;
;;; for example, to store a new person in a variable p, use this:
;;;
;;; (SETF p (make-person :name "Barbara" :parent1 "Fred" :parent2 "Carol"))
;;;
;;;

;;; The DEFSTRUCT function tells Lisp to autmatically create
;;; getter functions for each slot.  Their names are based on
;;; the names of the slots:
;;;
;;;  "person-name" will get the value stored in the NAME slot
;;;  "person-parent1" will get the value in the PARENT1 slot
;;;

;;; The LOOP function (macro) is used to iterate in many ways.
;;; Here are some examples:
;;;
;;; (LET ((newlist nil)
;;;       (mylist (LIST 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)))
;;;   (LOOP for i in mylist DOING
;;;     (SETF newlist (APPEND newlist (LIST (+ i 1)))))
;;;   newlist)
;;;
;;;  The above will make a new list that contains
;;;  numbers that are one more than their corresponding
;;;  elements in mylist.  Notice that the new sum is added
;;;  at the END of the growing new list!
;;;  This could also be done more elegantly in Lisp using
;;;  a nameless lambda function
;;;
;;;  (LET ((mylist (LIST 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)))
;;;    (MAPCAR #'(lambda (x) (+ x 1)) mylist))
;;;
;;; MAPCAR applies its first argument (a function) to each
;;; element in the second argument (a list), and collects
;;; the results of all the function calls into a new list
;;; and returns that list.
;;;
;;; Here is another LOOP example that does the same thing:
;;;
;;; (LET ((mylist (LIST 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)))
;;;  (LOOP for x in mylist collecting
;;;     (+ x 1)))
;;;
