# OPL-Lisp
This was a group project I worked on with two of my classmates for the course Organization of Programming Language.
In this project "Family Tree", we use the language LISP to create a family tree program.
The program could read in a text file contain information of parental and marriage relationships, and perform tasks such as determining relationship between arbitrary two people whose
name have been in the file. Whether it's siblings,ancestors,cousins, or not related.
For cousins, the program is able to determine the degree to which they are related. E.g., 0 degree cousins are siblings, and so on.
